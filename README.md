# Workshop - Odds and Events

UPDATE - I was able to fix the SortAll button by first turning the input into a a string.  This was being done in SortOne which allowed SortAll to work but only after a click on SortOne turned state.bank.toString().
All 3 buttons on the HTML form are working.
1. Add numbers updates the Number Bank
2. Sort 1 - Moves numbers from Number Bank to Odds or Evens respectively
3. Sort All initially worked only after clicking "Sort 1" one time first.  The code has been fixed.

In this workshop, you'll continue to get more practice working with events and event handlers. The goal is to create an app that allows a user to enter a number which gets placed into a number bank. The user can then sort the numbers in the bank into one of two categories: odd or even.

![Preview of the app: a user types 9 into the input field and clicks a button to add it to a number bank. The user then clicks the "Sort 1" button. The 9 is moved from the number bank into the "odd" category.](odds_and_events-example_flow.png)
